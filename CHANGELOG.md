## 1.15.0 (2025-04-08)

- Added `xframe_options_exempt` setting to allow embedding livecomponents views in iframes.

## 1.14.0 (2024-12-26)

- Relaxed Python and Django dependencies: Python: 3.11 and newer (3.12, etc.), Django: 4.x and 5.x.

## 1.13.0 (2024-09-24)

- Created documentation for the project. The documentation is available in the "docs" directory and on the https://om-proptech.github.io/livecomponents/ website.
- Improved the createlivecomponent management command: fixed the Python template and added --stateless and --minimal options to create stateless components or minimal components (without sample methods).
- Add --base-class option to the createlivecomponent management command to specify the base class for the component. Make it possible to define the base classes for stateful and stateless components in the settings.
- Added "no_morph" and "component_selector" templatetags.

## 1.12.4 (2024-08-15)

- Improved serialization for Django forms and models: pickle now correctly handles unsaved Django model instances and validates bound forms during unpickling.

## 1.12.3 (2024-08-14)

- Created populate_form_with_data() utility function to populate a form with data from the user input.

## 1.12.2 (2024-08-14)

- Improved support for ModelForm with instances.

## 1.12.1 (2024-08-13)

- Added support for ModelForm in livecomponents (fixed pickling error).

## 1.12.0 (2024-07-29)

- Added a "registration" app to show how to use livecomponents with Django forms.

## 1.11.1 (2024-02-26)

- Added `livecomponents_login_required` decorator to require a user to be logged in to call a component method.

## 1.11.0 (2024-02-08)

- Kept sessions marked as deleted for an hour before purging them from the Redis store. This change is to allow the client to recover from a session deletion when the user navigates back to the page.

## 1.10.0 (2024-01-25)

- Added CancelRendering() exception. The exception makes it possible to cancel the command execution and return an empty string instead of a half-rendered component or an exception.

## 1.9.0 (2023-12-22)

- Added ComponentId, which is a str subclass that can be used to create child component IDs from a parent component ID using the "|" separator.
- Added ReplaceUrl execution result. This result is used to replace the current URL in the browser as a result of a command execution.
- Improved support for stateless live components. They don't store mock state objects in Redis anymore.

## 1.8.0 (2023-12-18)

- Added helper method StateAddress.with_component_id() to create a StateAddress with the same session ID, but a different component ID.
- Added reference to the state manager to InitStateContext and UpdateStateContext.
- Added "find_ancestor(ancestor_type)" method to StateAddress and CallContext.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking Change**. Modified get_extra_context_data() to accept an instance of ExtraContextRequest(). This instance includes the component state, component_kwargs, current request, component state address, and the state manager. By including the state manager and address, it becomes possible to access stores for other components.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking Change**. Removed the passing of component kwargs to init_state() and update_state(). These kwargs are redundant since both InitStateContext and UpdateStateContext already have them.
- Added StatelessLiveComponent as a base class for components that do not need to store state.

## 1.7.0 (2023-12-13)

- Added `key={component_id}` to the output of the `{% component_attrs %}` templatetag. The "key" attribute is used as a hint for Apline Morph to identify
  elements that need to be updated.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking Change**. Modified get_extra_context_data() method to accept component_kwargs, allowing extra context population from parent components without storing in Redis. Note: This change is backward incompatible, altering the method signature to include \*\*component_kwargs.

## 1.6.0 (2023-12-05)

- Added {% component_ancestor %} templatetag.
- Documented templatetags. See "Templatetags" in the README.md.

## 1.5.0 (2023-12-05)

- Made it possible to use nested components. The change required updating the hierarchy separator from "/" to "|" and type separator from "." to ":".
- Updated the "createlivecomponent" command. The new command accepts the component path and deduces the component name from it.

## 1.4.2 (2023-11-10)

- Marked LiveComponent as abstract base class.

## 1.4.1 (2023-11-10)

- Made UpdateStateContext importable directly from livecomponents

## 1.4.0 (2023-11-10)

- Made it possible to re-render the component state on re-render.

## 1.3.0 (2023-11-06)

- Added support for handling uploads and provide a sample app to demonstrate the functionality. Refer to "Handling Uploads" in the README.md.

## 1.2.0 (2023-10-26)

- Returned HTTP 410 Gone status code on missing session ID. See "Error handling" in the README.md.

## 1.1.0 (2023-10-25)

- Added support for saving context to a Redis store. See "Storing Component Context" in the README.md.

## 1.0.0 (2023-10-24)

- Implemented the first version of livecomponents.
